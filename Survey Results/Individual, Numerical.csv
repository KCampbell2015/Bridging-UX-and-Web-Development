1) Our project manager gave us this, he felt that it was true:
http://www.globalnerdy.com/2011/08/03/the-war-between-developers-designers-and-project-managers/

Of course, this graph illustrates my biggest pet peeve on the job... one of the developers would always say, \"I'll wait for you to get done making it look pretty.\" 

We do a lot more than that.

2) Because we work onsite for our client - it's not a traditional software development team. We have a lot of stakeholders with heavy sway on the team that do not know a lot about software development. So a lot of my job is spent educating them on what I should be doing, how I should be doing it, then doing it, then documenting that process, presenting it, etc. I would say 70% of my job on this project has been education.
