-The water was very muddy between the user's needs and clients' wants, my role was to try and walk the line between making what was right and satisfying a diverse set of stakeholders","Visual design, Information architecture, Usability evaluation","HTML, CSS, jQuery","User research, Requirements analysis, Wireframe creation, UI sketching, Screen rendering (e.g. pixel-perfect mockups), Physical prototyping (e.g. paper), Digital prototyping (e.g. HTML, Flash), Design documentation, Implementation (e.g. writing production HTML and CSS)), Bug reporting, Bug fixing, Writing of user guides or training materials","-Though I didn't know a lot of backend code, it was very important for me to be able to know the difference between what was front end and what was backend. I had to quickly learn about the framework the software was built in and what it's basic capabilities were and how to build on them (Eclipse RCP). 
-It's important that interaction designer's feel comfortable and confident in speaking with developers about the backend code to build trust with each other.","I am assigned tasks by other members of my team through it., I create tasks for myself in it., I create tasks for other team members in it., I report bugs in it., I receive bug reports to be fixed through it., I attach design deliverables to tasks/issues in it.","I use it for version control of my production code.","Other, please specify (Ideally, the developers and I are to work closely together during the design phase... but it typically works out that they gloss over the document or attend a few meetings and get a basic understanding of what we are planning on doing, but never pay attention to the full details. Then they tend to come to me with questions or \"are  you crazy? I can't do that!\" when it's time for them to put together a timeline for their development assessment. After a few times of close calls, they are beginning to pay more attention to the pencil sketches and overall workflows we put together for them.)","","No","Other, please specify (I have - but rarely, typically once I hand over the front end HTML & CSS  - the developers tie the backend in to the code. They generally tweak and change it so they leave me out of the code reviews.)","They attend meetings when the designs are being discussed. Also, the design team goes to them while working out workflows/sketches/storyboards and ideas to present to the stakeholders - but generally they are so busy that they can't go into the code and answer the question thoroughly. ","I consider some of them to be good friends., I respect their skills and value their input., It is a purely business relationship., They consider me to be the one that \"makes things pretty\"., They have no respect for, or understanding of, what I do., Other, please specify (I find there to be a difference between some of the older developers and younger developers. The older ones are a little confused by my role as an interaction designer. The younger ones really seem to value my input and user center design processes. They are excited about the changes and like to contribute new ideas. The older developers who seem to have a different school of thought start shaking their head as soon as I stop by their desk with a fresh stack of sketches. )","2 final thoughts:

1) Our project manager gave us this, he felt that it was true:
http://www.globalnerdy.com/2011/08/03/the-war-between-developers-designers-and-project-managers/

Of course, this graph illustrates my biggest pet peeve on the job... one of the developers would always say, \"I'll wait for you to get done making it look pretty.\" 

We do a lot more than that.

2) Because we work onsite for our client - it's not a traditional software development team. We have a lot of stakeholders with heavy sway on the team that do not know a lot about software development. So a lot of my job is spent educating them on what I should be doing, how I should be doing it, then doing it, then documenting that process, presenting it, etc. I would say 70% of my job on this project has been education.
